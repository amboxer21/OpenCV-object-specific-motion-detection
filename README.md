# OpenCV-object-specific-motion-detection
Track any object that you specify using opencv and tensorflow by comparing(diffing) the objects coordinates. Each time the object moves, the coordinates are updated and stored in a secondary coordinate variable. This software is used to detect if a specific object(i.e., dog, cat, person, etc) is moving. You specify the object to track!
